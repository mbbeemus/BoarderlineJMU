			<h2>Maddie Schiller</h2>
			<h5>President</h5>
			<p>Home Mountain: Snowshoe, West Virginia</p>
			<p>"I’ve been skiing since I was about 4 and started snowboarding when I was 10. Skiing and riding make me feel most alive and help me forget about everything else in the world. My family would always go on trips together, and I always loved it. I’ve gotten to see so many beautiful places because of these sports and I could not imagine a better way to spend a day than being on the mountain! I joined BL my freshmen year during COVID, so it was more difficult to make friends since so many were still at home, classes were all online, and there was not much going on at JMU. Joining BL gave me some of my best friends and best times at JMU. There are some friendships I’ve made in BL that I know will be lifetime friendships, and that is something I value so much about this club. I was definitely scared going into BL, but I was so accepted and loved immediately, and knew I had found my home. I love Boarderline because being able to do some of my favorite activities ever with some of my favorite people who also love spending their days at the mountain is a dream come true. We are a tight knit group, who love to shred together but also do so many amazing and fun things together when it’s not ski season. We’ve been through some extremely challenging times together, but have always turned those challenges into moment where we grow, support each other, and find ways to keep each other going. Joining Boarderline as a scared little freshmen was the best decision I made, and being president this year has been truly an amazing experience!"</p>

			<p>"I came to JMU to get away from some of the cold weather in New England, and ended up joining the ski club as soon as I got here! I have been skiing since I was four years old and I realized could not just give it up. I quickly realized that Boarderline is the best club on campus and brings together an amazing group of people with a shared passion. From trying backflips in the Montana powder to geting lost in the woods at Steamboat, Boarderline has brought memories that will last a lifetime."</p>

Over the past few years I have grown to be a more passionate and much better snowboarder overall. Fun fact: my snowboard is 30 years old and came with some of the first step on bindings ever made “K2 clickers” (they suck) (the board is sick)"</p>
